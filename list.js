    analogy 1 for your context:
    actors: employer / domestic maid / employment agency / kitchen equipment.
    script: politically correctness, the employer should teach the maid how to use his kitchen equipment, how to cook dishes he wants.  Ridiculous is when employer goes back to employment agency asking agency to teach maid how to use their kitchen equipment and how to cook!!!`);

I now know that's the most unlikely thing ever to have been, because millions of years have passed over evolution, people have scattered across the face of this earth, been isolated from each other, developed independently, had different intermixtures between races, peoples, climates, soils... I didn't start off with that knowledge. But by observation, reading, watching, arguing, asking, and then bullying my way to the top, that is the conclusion I've come to.
